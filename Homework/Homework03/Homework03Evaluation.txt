Homework03 Evaluation
======================

Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

It's better to NOT use long lines of dashes to separate the
blocks of code in your file.  I know the book does it, but it's
kind of jarring when reading the code.  Instead, try using the
JavaDocs convention, like this:

/**
 *  this method blah blah blah woof woof
 * @param whatever
 * @param whatever
 * @returns something
 * @throws  SomeException
 */

THANK YOU for the file headers!  Very helpful.

Try to add a few more tests next time, to make sure you check things
like zero values, lists that are already sorted, negative numbers,
lists that are sorted in reverse order, palindromes, duplicates, and
so on.  It's also useful to output what is going on, like "testing
blah blah bozo bozo, expecting 1 2 3 4 5" and then the result, "got
1 2 3 4 5".

The Simon game is awesome!  Great work.

Total credit is 13 for Sorter and either Simon or Huffman
 extra credit is 7 points for other of Simon or Huffman
-------------------------
 Grand total is 20 points for all three

you got 13 out of 13 which is 100% which is an A-plus
