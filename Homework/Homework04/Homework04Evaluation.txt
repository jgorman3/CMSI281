Homework04 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment...
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Your code looks great and thanks for doing headers!

These were from Lindsey's repo.

Pretty minimal testing on the BinaryTree program.. you could
use a few more test cases and it would be nice to see what the
expected outputs are along with the actuals... but it works!

PriorityQ is really nice.  Good testing coverage and it tells
the user what's going on pretty well.  Still could use some
"expected" vs. "actual" comparisons in the output.

I get a compile error when I compile the StringHasher program
because you basically have two copies of the same thing.
Neither one of them has a main() method, so I can't run it,
but you wrote code, so I'll give you 1/2 credit on that.

The HashTableApp also has problems.  When I run it, I entered
193 for the size and then no matter what number I use for the
initialization count, it crashes with a divide by zero error.
Still, you wrote code for it, so 1/2 credit.
