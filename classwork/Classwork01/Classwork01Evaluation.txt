Classwork01 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

There is no file header.  You should have at least something!

You never prompt the user to enter a name, so your program just
sits there waiting; if I didn't know what was supposed to happen,
I'd think my computer was hung up!

Also, your repository structure is incorrect.  Please take a
look at the Assignment Submissions section of the week 01 web
page and make your structure look like that one.

Still, you get 93% out of 100% on this.
