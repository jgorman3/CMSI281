Classwork05 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Looks good, but throws an IllegalArgumentException on the
last line of your tests.  Probably because the queue is
empty at that point and you aren't catching that fact.
Something to remember for next time!
