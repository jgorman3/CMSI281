Classwork02 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, except your directory
structure is still incorrect.

Please correct it for Classwork02, and make it look
like what is specified on the syllabus page.  If this
is not done this week, it will start costing you points
on your submissions.  Grace period is over, sir!

Unfortunately, your TargetFile.java does not compile.  The
problem is your try/catch block is incorrectly specified.
You only have the "try" part, the declaration of the "writer"
object is out of order, and there is no "catch" part.  You
were also missing a closing brace near the bottom of the file.

Here is what I had to make your file look like to get it to
compile:

.......
  //copy file method
  public static void fileCreator() throws IOException {
    String newfile = file + ".copy";
    try {
      Writer writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(newfile), "utf-8"));
      writer.write(string_buff);
      writer.close();
    }
    catch( IOException ioe ) {};
  }
.......
